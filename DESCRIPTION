Description: More about what it does
    This package is designed to help you learn about chess by exploring pieces, the board, and 
  visualizing movement. It tells the user about the pieces by listing the name, beginning notation,
  movement, points associated with it (to communicate its value), and the number of that piece on 
  the board. This package also contains a graph of a chess board to show chess board notation and
  to show how the pieces can move.
